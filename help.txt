OSLICENSE(1)

NAME
    oslicense - Generates license files and retrieves license text and
        information.

SYNOPSIS
    oslicense [--help] [<args>] [<license-id>]

DESCRIPTION
    Retrieves license text from Open Source Initiative and saves it to a license
    file or prints it to the console.
    
    The saved license file may have placeholders for license holder names,
    dates, etc. that will need to be replaced manually.

OPTIONS
    <license-id>
        Specifying <license-id> will retrieve the text for that license, if the
        license ID matches an Open Source Initiative license. To show a list of
        all available licenses and IDs, use the --list option.
        
        If <license-id> is omitted, the nearest package.json file will be used
        to specify the license ID, starting in the current working directory and
        checking parent directories. If a package.json file is found AND it
        contains a 'license' property, the 'license' value will be used for
        <license-id>.
    
    -h, --help
        Show this help text.
    
    -l, --list
        Lists all available OSI license names and IDs.
        
        Example:
            
            License-ID-01:
                License 01 Name
            
            License-ID-02:
                License 02 Name
        
        The license IDs returned in this list can be used for the <license-id>
        argument.
    
    -o, --output <path>
    <path>
        Specifies an alternate output file name and/or directory for the
        generated license file. Relative paths are relative to the current
        working directory.
        
        Without this argument, a license file named "LICENSE.md" will be created
        in the current working directory.
        
        If <path> is a name that does not exist (in a directory that does
        already exist), then the license file will use that name instead.
        
        If <path> is a directory, the license file will be created in that
        directory using the default file name, "LICENSE.md".
        
        If <path> is a file that already exists, or is in a directory that does
        not exist, then the script will return an error.
    
    -s, --stdout
        If specified, the license text will be printed to stdout instead of
        being saved to a file.
